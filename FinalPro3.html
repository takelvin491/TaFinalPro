        In 1993, the video game film made its debut with the acid-dipped bomb-omb that was Super Mario Bros. 
        The Mario brothers are portrayed in the film by John Leguizamo as Luigi Mario and Bob Hoskins as Mario Mario. 
        When the brothers of Bathymetry, who were born in Brooklyn, witness a kidnapping, they are on another job. The pursuit that follows transports them to an other dimension. 
        As they try to save the abducted princess Daisy, the brothers arrive in what is essentially a huge underground city ruled by King Koopa, played by Dennis Hopper.
        The dialogue in the movie was considered subpar at the time and remains so today. 
        The tale itself is a bit out of date, and many of the visual effects didn't hold up over time. 
        It has been reported that Nintendo didn't give the film crew any thought or direction, so they were essentially left to fend for themselves. Additionally, a lot of what came out of the process was, let's say, a process of discovery since this kind of stuff had never really been done before.
        </p>

        <p>
        In 1994, Super Mario Bros. was followed by Street Fighter, another video game film from an already well-known brand. 
        This film resembled a more conventional action film from the late 1970s or early 1980s, but it used more sophisticated production methods from the mid-1990s. 
        Even though Jean Claude Van Damme, Raul Julia, and the other young actors in the cast give excellent performances, the movie still didn't appear to live up to the expectations of both fans and critics at the time regarding what a Street Fighter movie should be.
        Despite what appears by all accounts to have been a competent production and cast and crew, there were external factors that made making the movie difficult. 
        The filming location of Bangkok was very hot and humid during filming, making everything that much tougher. Raul Julia was diagnosed with cancer and was in the midst of that and treatment for it while delivering his stellar performance as M Bison. And while shooting in Thailand they had to deal with a potential coup at one point, prompting a series of 1 am boat rides down a river to filming locations for a time due to safety concerns.
        In spite of the cast, crew, and production seem to have been good, there were outside issues that made the filmmaking challenging. Everything was made more difficult by the extremely hot and muggy conditions in Bangkok, where the movie was shot. While giving his outstanding performance as M Bison, Raul Julia was undergoing treatment for cancer, which he had been diagnosed with. 
        Additionally, they had to contend with a possible coup during filming in Thailand, which led to a period of time spent on a series of 1 am boat journeys down a river to filming sites because of safety concerns.
        </p>

        <p>
        As the Guardian notes in an article on its production,
        </p>
        <blockquote class="Ori">
            "it was derided as another ludicrous cash-in tossed at impressionable kids by cynical Hollywood execs,"
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         indicating that critics were ultimately unimpressed with the movie. 
        <span class="Prof">Nevertheless, it turned out that Street Fighter was more profitable than Mario had been. 
        Furthermore, people still have positive memories of Raul Julia's well-known "Tuesday" speech as Bison, despite the criticism of the time. In general, I like to draw comparisons between Street Fighter and early 1970s Bond movies, which had big character casts, enormous set pieces, an excessive amount of pyrotechnics, lengthy combat scenes, and a lot of corny dialogue. In the end, there's also a sort of Seven Samurai thing going on.</span>

        <h2>Video game movie spin-offs</h2>
        <p>
        Then Mortal Kombat was released in 1995. <span class="Fi">The fact that this film was also a financial success suggests that Hollywood had begun to understand what works at this point</span>. 
        From this point on, the formula had really begun to take shape, and the action-with-a-dash-of-comedy aspect was practically a given in many video game films. 
        Whether you like or dislike corny action movies will determine whether it is a good or bad thing. These films' casts tended to focus on more recent or obscure performers who could better inhabit their roles rather than employing a big-name star like Van Damme as a hook.
        </p>

        <p>
        Although there were other films that contributed to the development of the video game movie genre, I believe it is reasonable to argue that these three were the most significant. 
        Furthermore, all three films have a lot in common that some viewers may or may not find appealing, including their use of humor and unafraid tongue-in-cheek, their tendency to be action-adventure films that follow a preexisting formula, their use of less-than-A-list actors, and the higher budget allocated to effects.
        </p>

        <p>
        It's true that making video game movies is usually not inexpensive. Since video games are by their very nature an effects-driven medium, it makes sense that the budget for a video game movie would need to include additional funds for effects. 
        Then there's the problem of finding actors who fit the characters that are already well-known, then assembling all the people you typically need to make a movie, and lastly figuring out how to make everything work together in a single, seamless production to create a film that complements the games that already exist. 
        In contrast to a brand-new, let's call it more open film, where no pre-existing properties or viewer expectations need to be accommodated in any manner, it's by no means a simple task.
        </p>

        <p>
        These kinds of developmental difficulties have happened to other genres before, anyway. If you were to compare sectoral perspectives on the horror genre, say from 1950, 1970, 1990, and presently, you would see four quite different genres. 
        Even with the ability of combining computer and practical effects that was available at the time, some of the finer CGI of today would have been challenging, if not impossible, in the 1990s. 
        The horror genre of today is capable of far more than they were able to accomplish in the 1950s or 1970s. Video games itself didn't really take off until the 1970s with the Atari, and Nintendo didn't notice until the 1980s after that platform died.
        its ascent to fame. <span class="Yx">Since the first Mario film was released in 1993, this genre hasn't even been around for thirty years. Perhaps it simply requires a bit more time?</span>
