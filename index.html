        In recent years, the video game business is worth <span class="Mon">$100 billion</span> worldwide, and over two-thirds of American households have someone who plays video games on a daily basis. 
        And it's really no surprise—video games have been around for decades and are available on a variety of platforms, 
        including mobile devices, home consoles, handheld consoles, and arcade systems. Additionally, they frequently lead the way in computer technology. 
        Despite most video game consoles being found in households all over the world today,  video games actually originated in scientific research facilities.
        </p>

       
        <p>
        For example, <span class="Ral">Oxo, also called noughts and crosses or a tic tac toe, was invented in 1952 by British academic A.S. Douglas as part of his doctoral research at the University of Cambridge.</span> 
        Additionally, William Higinbotham developed Tennis for Two for the annual visitor's day at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York, in 1958 using a massive analog computer and an oscilloscope screen.
        The computer-based space combat video game Spacewar! was created in 1962 by Steve Russell at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the PDP-1 (Programmed Data Processor-1), a state-of-the-art computer that was mostly used in colleges at the time. 
        Playable on several computers, it was the first video game of its kind. 
        </p>
      

        <p>
        In 1967, developers at Sanders Associates, Inc., led by Ralph Baer, invented a prototype multiplayer, multi-program video game system that could be played on a television. It was known as <span class="BB">"Brown Box.”</span>
        Baer, who’s sometimes referred to as Father of Video Games, licensed his device to Magnavox, which sold the system to consumers as the Odyssey, the first video game home console, in 1972. Over the next few years, the primitive Odyssey console would commercially fizzle and die out.
        Yet, one of the Odyssey’s 28 games was the inspiration for Atari’s Pong, the first arcade video game, which the company released in 1972. In 1975, Atari released a home version of Pong, which was as successful as its arcade counterpart.

        <h2>The history of video games</h2>
        <p>
        <span class="Comp">A number of factors contributed to the 1983 "crash" of the North American video game industry, including an oversaturated market for game consoles, competition from computer gaming, and an abundance of overhyped, 
        subpar games, like the notorious Atari game E.T., which was based on the movie of the same name and has become known as the worst game ever made.</span>
        Several home computer and video game console firms went bankrupt as a result of the crash, which lasted for a few years.
        When the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), known as Famicom in Japan, arrived in the US in 1985, 
        the video game home market started to rebound. Compared to earlier consoles, the NES had better 8-bit visuals, colors, music, and playability.
        </p>

        <p>
        In order to fight hurried, subpar software, Nintendo also placed a number of restrictions on third-party games created on their platform. 
        Numerous other enduring brands, like Capcom's <span class="red">Mega Man, Konami's Castlevania, Square's Final Fantasy, and Enix's Dragon Quest (Square and Enix would later unite to form Square Enix in 2003)</span>, were also produced by third-party creators.
        When Nintendo released the 8-bit Game Boy video game system and the frequently included Tetris game in 1989, it created a stir once more by popularizing handheld gaming. 
        Nintendo would produce several popular Game Boy replacements over the following 25 years, such as the Game Boy Color in 1998, the Nintendo DS in 2004, and the Nintendo 3DS in 2011.
