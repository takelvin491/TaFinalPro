            I've had a customary year-end piece at TheGamer for the last two years. I wrote in 2021 that 2022 would be a fantastic year for gaming. Okay, 
            This Time I Mean It: 2023 Will Be A Great Year For Video Games was written in 2022. Those two titles make it clear that I wasn't really impressed by 2022. 
            Although it had the blockbuster hit of God of War Ragnarok (with the same disclaimer in parentheses) and the technological innovations of Elden Ring (though they weren't to my liking), it wasn't very good. 2023 ended the trend of 2021 being a bad year for games as well, which I had previously wrote about. 
            Although 2023 was mathematically the greatest year in games for twenty years, 2020 is a stronger contender than is often acknowledged for its brilliance. What does 2024 hold, then?
            </p>

            <p class ="clear"> 
            Even though I won my wager on 2023 going huge, I'm not placing a large wager on 2024. Where does that leave us, given that we don't have a lot planned yet and there's little reason to anticipate another enormous year? 
            2024 has enormous shoes to fill after 2023, and if its toes don't reach the wingtips, it can't be considered a failure. 
            However, how gaming develops in 2023 may help us predict our future course, and even if it's not a year that will go down in history, it may at least offer a fascinating addition to the canon of video games.
            </p>

            <p>
            Of course, you are surprised by these things sometimes. 
            Among this year's top picks are Alan Wake 2 and Baldur's Gate 3, neither of which was widely discussed before the year officially began. 
            Tears of the Kingdom, Final Fantasy 16, Kill the Justice League, Starfield, Diablo 4, Fire Emblem Engage, Redfall, Stellar Blade, and Street Fighter 6 are just a handful of the titles that come to mind when I enumerate the reasons why 2023 may be amazing. Not a perfect hit rate, exactly.

        <p>
        Both Kill the Justice League and Stellar Blade were postponed till 2024, but as we've learned more, I and the public have grown less fond of them, so I don't think either of those are very noteworthy for 2024's naked cap. 
        Some of the games in the collection met or exceeded expectations, while others fell short. In the instance of Street Fighter 6, the latter may have gone above and beyond. Who's to say 2024 won't contain surprise packages, though, which made 2023 so amazing?
        </p>

        The indies are the industry's steady lifeblood, as I've already discussed recently, so complaining that 2024 is a write-off because Ghost of Tsushima 2 isn't planned seems a little hypocritical. 
        I have no problem acknowledging that it is. However, even if the critic and analyst are the same person, there is a difference between them urging gamers to search a little more widely for their next favorite game and an analyst looking at 2024's calendar and release schedules and forecasting a less stellar year for big new titles.
        </p>

        <p>
        With fewer releases and many of them restricted by the pandemic, 2021 was a year that was constantly tiny. The top games of 2022 were better than those of 2021, but there were also more significant letdowns, including Nintendo Switch Sports, Saints Row, and Pokemon Scarlet & Violet. 
        As we all know, 2023 was fantastic and jam-packed with goodies. 2024 is not expected to be like 2023. However, is it adrift like 2022 or empty like 2021? Is it a third-party secret? Moreover, will it establish the tone for 2025 and later? 
        Since 2020 was a console launch year, 2024 is the first "normal" year the industry has had since that year. <span class="Norm">It may also be the first normal year since 2019. 
        In what manners will it effect the future of gaming and how will it compare to the other years in this decade? We'll have to wait and see, I suppose.</span>
