                The role of video games in society gained a familiar media attention following two mass shootings earlier this month in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas. 
                In his "manifesto," the El Paso shooter made a passing allusion to Call of Duty, a hugely popular video game where players take on the roles of soldiers during real and imagined conflict. 
                And President Donald Trump seems to have resorted to a topic he has previously reinforced when seeking to place more responsibility for violent acts as a result of this brief reference to the video game.
                He stated at a press conference on August 5 that
                </p>
                <blockquote class="Vi">
                    "we must stop the glorification of violence in our society." 
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                This also applies to the gory and graphic video games that are now widely available. 
                Today, it is far too simple for problematic adolescents to associate with a culture that glorifies violence.
                </p>

                <p>
                However, blaming video games for any form of real-world violence is not a recent invention; 
                it is a long-standing political and cultural practice that dates back to the 1970s. 
                Depending on the time period, it may also be a part of a broader, recurrent wave of worry about any mainstream culture that has been seen as morally aberrant, ranging from rock 'n' roll to the occult. 
                <span class="Ti">However, video games have once again become a prime target as mass shootings continue to happen around the country and efforts to prevent them by passing gun control legislation continue to be contentious.</span>
                The latest commotion resulted from an altercation between a number of old enemies. One corner is occupied by politicians such as Trump who point to video games as proof of the detrimental effects of violent and immoral media on society. 
                Another group consists of video game players who oppose this interpretation while attempting to make their own arguments against the violence in games. In another, scientists disagree on whether there are both causative and factual connections between violence in the real world and video games. 
                Additionally, there are elements of the public who respond even more alarmingly when politicians and the mass media spread alarmist ideas about games.
                </p>

                <p>
                However, it appears that the argument that playing violent video games causes violence in the real world has recently gained more traction. 
                This criticism is coming from a variety of sources, including scientists, some media outlets, and even survivors of horrific shootings: After surviving the 2018 Parkland, Florida, mass shooting, David Hogg became an advocate for gun reform. 
                In August, he announced a new March for Our Lives campaign, emphatically saying on Twitter, 
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    "We know video games aren't to blame."
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                There is also a feeling of increasing frustration on all sides due to the fact that not much has changed since our last argument, as well as since the time before that and the time before that.

        <h2>Controversies in the Gaming Industry</h2>
        <p>
        While there have been a few mass shootings in the past when video games were directly responsible, the science relating video games to gun violence is not entirely clear. 
        A large amount of psychological research, the most of which was done prior to 2015, makes a strong case that playing violent video games can make people more aggressive. 
        However, more recent, conflicting data from psychologists and academics from other disciplines has called into question a large portion of this study. <span class="Cri">According to criminologist Nickie Phillips, whose work examines violence in popular media, for instance, "most criminologists are dismissive of a causal link between media and crime," preferring to focus on issues of violence as a social construct and its role in political discourse.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
        It's easy to get caught up in the science discussion, but it hides how obsessed America is with harmful media. 
        The controversy over the 1976 video game Death Race, which gave players points for running over fugitive civilians known as <span class="Grem">"gremlins,"</span> may be the oldest instance of moral panic over a video game. 
        Controversy surrounded the game, even leading to a 60 Minutes feature. It's interesting to note that other games from the same era, such as the military game Tank from 1974, which framed its gameplay through combat bloodshed, did not raise as much public outrage.
        </p>

        <p>
        Psychologist Patrick Markey notes in his 2017 book Moral Combat: <span class="Pat">Why the War on Violent Video Games Is Wrong that many concerned citizens were worried about arcades before they became fixated on video games, 
        not because of the games they held but rather because they were licentious places for teenagers to congregate. (Here, insert "Ya Got Trouble.") 
        By the 1980s, activist parents determined to shield their kids from the harmful influences that lurked in these neon-drenched dungeons were closing arcades all over the country, according to Markey.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
        Then, Midway Games' Mortal Kombat, which became notorious for its graphic "fatality" moves, emerged as the franchise that turned arcade dread into gameplay panic. 
        Concerned parents became so enraged by Mortal Kombat's 1992 arcade debut that a congressional hearing was held in 1993 and the Entertainment Software Rating Board, or ESRB, was established. 
        Every time a new fighting game is released, controversy is still generated. 
        Regarding the widespread fear around Mortal Kombat in the 1990s, Cypheroftyr, a gaming critic who usually goes by her online handle, told me over the phone 
        </p>
        <blockquote class="Opera">
            "Like people were really going to go out and rip people's spines out." 
        </blockquote>
        <p>
        Cypheroftyr is the founder of the charity organization I Need Diverse Games and a passionate shooter and action gamer.
        "I'm old enough to remember the whole Jack Thompson era of trying to say video games are violent and they should be banned," she remarked, alluding to the prominent obscenity lawyer who was disbarred for his decades-long, vehement campaign against video games and other media.

        <h3>List of controversies in the gaming world</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                "Death Race," the first contentious video game, was taken off store shelves.
                Running over as many "gremlins" as you can in a set amount of time is the goal of this low-fidelity black and white game, which resembles a little more complex version of Pong. "What got everyone upset about Death Race was that you heard this little 'ahhhk' when the person got hit, and a little gravestone came up," says Steve L. Kent, a video game historian. The maker of Death Race removes the game from the market in response to public uproar.
            </li>
            <li>
                The first video game with realistic, genuine violence is Mortal Kombat. It is the main topic of the 1993 Congressional Hearings, along with Night Trap and Doom. 
                Mortal Kombat remains in stores because the Entertainment Software Ratings Board was established as a self-regulatory organization to avoid possible government regulation.
            </li>
            <li>
                "Grand Theft Auto"'s Release Stirs Up Controversy
                Almost immediately after its debut, the game gains recognition for its subject and methodology. Driving prostitutes around town, dodging the feds, running drugs and porn, and killing a lot of people are all part of the player's mission. 
                GTAIII's release is delayed in 2001, just after the 9/11 terrorist events, to change the game's New York City-related features.
            </li>
            <li>
                The player dashes at a Native American woman chained to a pole while dodging "enemy" arrows in the General Custer gaming persona. Custer would engage the woman for points once he arrived. 
                At the location where the public is watching the game for the first time, 250 protesters congregate; the event is never very successful.
            </li>
            <li>
                Surgeon General Discovers Minimal Link Between Media and Violence
                General Surgeon of the United States While the exact effect of video games on violent conduct is unknown, David Satcher, M.D., Ph.D., who leads a study on teenage violence, concludes that "findings suggest that media violence has a relatively small impact on violence." 
                The paper claims that, rather than media exposure, the best risk factors for school shootings are mental stability and the standard of family life.
            </li>
            <li>
                Oklahoma's Video Game Law Was Overturned
                The Western District Court of Oklahoma ruled in Entertainment Merchants Association v. Henry that the state's statute prohibiting the distribution of violent video games containing "inappropriate" content to minors is unconstitutional and issues a permanent injunction against its implementation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Collective Accusations Media Violence Poses a Health Risk
                In its "Media Violence" policy statement, the Council on Communications and Media of the American Academy of Pediatrics states: "Violent media exposure, such as that found in television, movies, music, and video games, poses a serious risk to children's and adolescents' health. 
                Violence in the media can lead to violent behavior, desensitization to violence, nightmares, and fear of harm, according to a wealth of study findings.
